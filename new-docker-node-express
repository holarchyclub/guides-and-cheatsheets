A set of simple steps to edit the file you want is:

    Go to the directory where your file is located.
    Write the command 
```
sudo nano package.json
```
    in the terminal; sudo will ensure that you have permissions for editing the file.
    Move to the end of the file with your arrow keys and write the change in your file.
    Press Ctrl + X to exit the application, then Y to save changes.
