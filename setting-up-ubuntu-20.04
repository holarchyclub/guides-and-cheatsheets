### This guide is the notes I took while setting up Ubuntu recently.
# My architecture is x64 bit AMD processor , with Ubuntu FOCAL - if you don't know yours check system settings
# Boot PC with a bootable USB of a flavor of Ubuntu that will run on your computer hardware
# Once you are booted, go to the menu that says 
# "install ubuntu" launch it > 
# select "normal installation" > 
# select do not download updates while installing > 
# select drive for installation (a drive tht can be reformatted)
# let the installer handle the partitioning, select a time zone, and hit continue
# when installed, reboot your computer

# on reboot once you sign in, open a terminal and use these commands
ufw status
# this is the firewall status
# update package repos
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
# restart the machine again
sudo shutdown -r
# now when you get back in, open a terminal
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
# set firewall up
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
# are you connecting to a cloud vps on a specific port? if do put the port number at the end of this, otherwise run as is
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
# great, we got our OS installed, we updated the repos, installed upgrades, and enabled the firewall to protect us while leaving ssh port 22 open
# we can be more specific than just "ssh" though and allow specific IP's like this [replace made up adress with IP of your VPS or ssh target]
sudo ufw allow from 102.394.madeupadress.14.7
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
# we are done! you can reboot for kicks with 'sudo shutdown -r' 

# the next step I took was installing docker which is noted in another file in the repository, check it out!
