# Guides and CheatsSheets
Hey :) this is holarchy.club's repository for guides and cheat sheets for anything techy or computer related !

The internet has yielded incredible free tools that can run  productive , scientific , and critical applications. Open source software is this closest thing we've had to a broadening commons and we believe strongly in making the open source stack as accessible as possible .

Many people have ideas for things , 
like developing a web application , running a website , uploading to a server , running linux at home ...
Yet there is a large chasm between ideation and execution - we love the idea of "cheat-sheets" that we can reference to help bridge gaps in understanding , while eliminating or reducing time spent "searching through the noise" of internet information .

## Please feel free to submit corrections, changes, and new sheets or guides ~ 
We also encourage people who don't have information to share to submit (in the "issues" tab) a topic that they are interested in or struggling with so that one of our collective engineers can make a corresponding guide !
